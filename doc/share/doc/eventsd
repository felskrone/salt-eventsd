###### GENERAL CONFIGURATION SETTINGS #######
#############################################
# general configuration settings for the daemon. Do not
# remove any unless you really know what you're doing!
general: 
    # where is the socket for the events located
    # /var/run/salt/master for salt-master
    # /var/run/salt/minion for the salt-minion
    # when run on a minion, always set 'node' to 'minion' too
    sock_dir: /var/run/salt/master
    node: master
    # the id the listener should use while listening for events
    # can by anything, but 'master' is advised on salt-master
    id: master
    # how many concurrent workers to start at most
    max_workers: 100
    # how many events to collect before starting a worker 
    # that dumps the collected events into the database
    # i suggest starting with one and raising it once it works
    event_limit: 1
    # where the daemon should put its pidfile
    pidfile: /var/run/salt-eventsd.pid

    # update the state_file

    # the loglevel to use for logging
    loglevel: debug
    # the logfile the daemon should log into
    logfile: /var/log/salt/eventsd
    # after how many seconds with no collected events should the daemon
    # start a worker to put the already collected events into the database

    # the backends to load on daemon-start, see the documentation in 
    # /usr/share/doc/salt-eventsd/backends.txt on how to write your own

##### CREDENTIALS FOR THE WORKERS #############
###############################################
# add each worker with its name and its credentials here.
# if no worker is defined but an entry called 'all'
# exists, all worker will use the settings from global
worker_credentials:

    # this entry will be used by any worker that is not explicitly defined
    all:
        username: <user>
        password: <password>
        hostname: <hostname>
        database: <database>
    # add a worker with its name here, to have it use its own credentials
       #Minion_Sub_Worker:
       #username: <user>
       #password: <password>
       #hostname: <hostname>
       #database: <database>
