checkout the workers directory in the python module for example on how two write workers. after importing the 
sql-scheme into a database and setting the right credentials in the config, you should 
have command+return logging i no time.

if you need more fine grained control, see the eventsd.extended config on how to use sub-events.

To configure the Elasticsearch worker, define the elasticsearch_host and
elasticsearch_port in worker_credentials. A new job worker can be configured
like so:

   es_new_job:
        backend: Elasticsearch_Worker
        # The Elasticsearch index to insert into
        index: cmd_hist
        # The Elasticsearch document type
        type: job
        tag:  salt/job/[0-9]*/new
        # List of functions to ignore
        ignore: [saltutil.find_job, foo, bar]

And a returns worker can be configured like so:

    es_return:
        backend: Elasticsearch_Worker
        # The Elasticsearch index to insert into
        index: returns
        # The Elasticsearch document type
        type: job
        tag:  salt/job/[0-9]*/ret/\w+
        # List of functions to ignore
        ignore: [saltutil.find_job]
