### stable version 0.9.1 Jan 19th 2015 ###

* Removed state_upd setting, it is replaced with a state_timer which fires every n seconds
  to update the status file /var/run/salt-eventsd.status

* Added two new values to status-file:
  - events_hdl_sec: the events the daemon has matched against its config per second
  - events_tot_sec: the total events received on the eventbus per second

  The old values are still there:
  - events_hdl: the total count of events handled
  - events_rec: the total count of events received
  - threads_created: the total number of threads created
  - threads_joined: the total number of threads joined

  to push them even further into a backend. this greatly simplifies monitoring
